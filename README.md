# Description

This repository contains Python notebooks with an automated spot detection algorithm. We have used this algorithm to analyze microscopy images of *S. elongatus* cells expressing a protein with a fluorescent tag. The algorithm quantifies the amount of fluorescence in localized spots in each cell, then normalizes this signal by the total fluorescence detected in cells.

- Python 3.12.7
- Matplotlib 3.9.2
- scikit-image 0.24.0
